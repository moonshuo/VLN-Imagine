Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) agents are tasked with navigating an unseen environment using natural language instructions. In this work, we study if visual representations of sub-goals implied by the instructions can serve as navigational cues and lead to increased navigation performance. To synthesize these visual representations or “imaginations”, we leverage a text-to-image diffusion model on landmark references contained in segmented instructions. These imaginations are provided to VLN agents as an added modality to act as landmark cues and an auxiliary loss is added to explicitly encourage relating these with their corresponding referring expressions. Our findings reveal an increase in success rate (SR) of ∼1 point and up to ∼0.5 points in success scaled by inverse path length (SPL) across agents. These results suggest that the proposed approach reinforces visual understanding compared to relying on language instructions alone.

```

4. Download checkpoints and features from [here](https://oregonstate.box.com/s/97n3i25m45wkrr1ivt3stah2x9cqabv1). Files include:
 - off-the-shelf ViT features for R2R-Imagine.
 - HAMT ViT features for R2R-Imagine.
 - HAMT-Imagine R2R checkpoint.
 - DUET-Imagine R2R checkpoint.

5. (optional) Download imagination generations for R2R from [here](https://oregonstate.box.com/s/v7ejpbxlol3mysammdw2mffpr33rpuwv) and metadata of generations and noun-phrase segments of R2R instructions from [here](https://oregonstate.box.com/s/97n3i25m45wkrr1ivt3stah2x9cqabv1).

6. Run - adjust paths of downloaded files and run training/inference for HAMT and DUET from the respective folders:
```
cd <folder-of-HAMT/DUET src>
bash scripts/run_r2r.sh
```
